A sample quiz app created as part of the assessment for the position of Senior Software Engineer.

## Steps on how to run the Web App

1. visit this link: [CORS proxy server](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/interview.mock.data/payload.json)
2. Click the "Request temporary access to demo server" button
3. The page should display "You currently have temporary access to the demo server." after clicking the button
4. Access the GiHub page: [Reiner Zamudio GitHub Page for CUPA Dev Test](https://rzamudio.github.io/cupa-dev-test/)

> NOTE: This is an important step that needs to be done before accessing the web app. This will bypass the CORS issue when initiating the API call. This is for demo purposes only.
